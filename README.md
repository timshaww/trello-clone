This project is a clone of Trello, a project management tool. 

I built this using NextJS, with TypeScript and TailwindCSS, and some help from shadcn's UI library. 

Visit it at [https://timshaww-trello.vercel.app/b/board-1](https://timshaww-trello.vercel.app/b/board-1)
Or, clone this repo and run it yourself!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Be sure to visit [/b/board-1](/b/board-1) to see the starter board!

Thanks for exploring üê°
